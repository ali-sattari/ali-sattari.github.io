## The Author

No better way to learn about someone than to check out [the books they read](https://hardcover.app/@ali.sattari), or [the code they write](https://github.com/ali-sattari), right?

## The Site
I first started blogging in 2004 in Persian, mostly about the Linux, front-end development, and web standards (it was the fad back then among cool kids), this continued to 2009 when I last published [a post](https://web.archive.org/web/20090729012240/http://weblog.corelist.net/archives/1388/03/21/wasp-mission/). 

I have been meaning to start a new blog in English for a while but I was so tired of setting up a CMS and fiddle with it. I wanted something different, and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) combined with [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) gave me that different thing: fewer hassles, better control, and minimum costs.
