While aggregation provides more readability in overviews, it also inadvertently hides nuances and details. Our aim should be to propose a sensible aggregation method that ensures we extract the most valuable insights, with a promise to review it often in order to keep it fit.
When do you need to aggregate? Leaders managing large organisations, which often includes many services and lots of SLIs, usually ask for overview dashboards and reports.</description></item><item><title>When to Alert on What?</title><link>https://ali.sattari.me/posts/2023/when-to-alert-on-what/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 09:10:11 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ali.sattari.me/posts/2023/when-to-alert-on-what/</guid><description>&lt;p>We have all been there when we go into a new company or team, looking at their stack and especially alerting, and something feels a bit &amp;hellip; off? This is an honest attempt to categorize alerting into some bands or levels, to make it easier to reason about where things are and have a glimpse at the road ahead. Or in other words, to put words on those vague feelings. The levels aren&amp;rsquo;t meant to be followed in sequence, some can be skipped, others not. Moreover, this is by no means a yet-another-maturity-model&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, use it as such at your own risk. The end goal of any alert is (besides being actionable) to detect problems affecting your users fast enough, without being too trigger-happy&lt;sup>[citation needed]&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What should be on a SLI dashboard</title><link>https://ali.sattari.me/posts/2021/what-should-be-on-a-sli-dashboard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 08:09:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ali.sattari.me/posts/2021/what-should-be-on-a-sli-dashboard/</guid><description>SRE practices and particularly the observability part help us keep a clear head by focusing on few key signals that matter, those that should reflect customer happiness1. But despite SRE being around for more than a decade, not all related people are onboard with the practice, some hesitation does come from poor implementation of the observability part[citation needed], giving various stakeholders feeling of loosing insight into their services. Hence to drive adoption, we should do better with visualizing SLIs that are supposed to replace the non-customer-centric metrics2 as center of attention.</description></item><item><title>Prometheus at Scale with Thanos: Timing Parameters</title><link>https://ali.sattari.me/posts/2021/prometheus-at-scale-with-thanos-timing-parameters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 09:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ali.sattari.me/posts/2021/prometheus-at-scale-with-thanos-timing-parameters/</guid><description>The story begins a few weeks or months after you have had the epiphany to scale out your Prometheus setup with Thanos. The new setup runs smoothly for a while with default parameters and you can shovel more resources from time to time to improve the performance. Such beautiful and simple times will soon be gone, one day you wake up to the reality that some heavy queries are taking most of the resources and grinding the whole system to a halt under load.</description></item><item><title>Axe Sharpening or Yak Shaving?</title><link>https://ali.sattari.me/posts/2020/axe-sharpening-or-yak-shaving/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2020 08:09:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ali.sattari.me/posts/2020/axe-sharpening-or-yak-shaving/</guid><description>We often use many tools in our everyday activities. Tools enable us to be faster and more precise while allowing us to engage issues at higher levels. Using tools we are leveraging other peopleâ€™s innovation and could stand on the shoulder of giants to gaze further horizons. This is so fundamental that knowing one&amp;rsquo;s toolset in and out is considered a sign of mastery or expertise in most crafts. By now you are thinking what is the catch?</description></item><item><title>Alerting issues with Alertmanager</title><link>https://ali.sattari.me/posts/2020/alerting-issues-with-alertmanager/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 09:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ali.sattari.me/posts/2020/alerting-issues-with-alertmanager/</guid><description>&lt;p>Alerting is a vital part of operations, as it frees humans from watching systems and let them tend to more creative and constructive activities, until something breaks&amp;hellip; at 3 am, but then resolves in few minutes, then fires again 10 minutes later, and that&amp;rsquo;s when you know alerting isn&amp;rsquo;t working properly!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://ali.sattari.me/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ali.sattari.me/about/</guid><description>The Author My short bio in most social network profiles is this: &amp;ldquo;Avid Reader, Full-time Skeptic, Site Rreliability Engineer&amp;rdquo;.
