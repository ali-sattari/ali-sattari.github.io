While aggregation provides more readability in overviews, it also inadvertently hides nuances and details. Our aim should be to propose a sensible aggregation method that ensures we extract the most valuable insights, with a promise to review it often in order to keep it fit.
When do you need to aggregate? Leaders managing large organisations, which often include many services and lots of SLIs, usually ask for overview dashboards and reports.</description></item><item><title>When to Alert on What?</title><link>https://ali.sattari.me/posts/2023/when-to-alert-on-what/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 09:10:11 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ali.sattari.me/posts/2023/when-to-alert-on-what/</guid><description>&lt;p>We have all been there when we go into a new company or team, looking at their stack and especially alerting, and something feels a bit &amp;hellip; off? This is an honest attempt to categorize alerting into some bands or levels, to make it easier to reason about where things are and have a glimpse at the road ahead. Or in other words, to put words on those vague feelings. The levels aren&amp;rsquo;t meant to be followed in sequence, some can be skipped, others not. Moreover, this is by no means a yet-another-maturity-model&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, use it as such at your own risk. The end goal of any alert is (besides being actionable) to detect problems affecting your users fast enough, without being too trigger-happy&lt;sup>[citation needed]&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What should be on a SLI dashboard</title><link>https://ali.sattari.me/posts/2021/what-should-be-on-a-sli-dashboard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 08:09:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ali.sattari.me/posts/2021/what-should-be-on-a-sli-dashboard/</guid><description>SRE practices and particularly the observability part help us keep a clear head by focusing on few key signals that matter, those that should reflect customer happiness1. But despite SRE being around for more than a decade, not all related people are onboard with the practice, some hesitation does come from poor implementation of the observability part[citation needed], giving various stakeholders feeling of loosing insight into their services. Hence to drive adoption, we should do better with visualizing SLIs that are supposed to replace the non-customer-centric metrics2 as center of attention.</description></item></channel></rss>
