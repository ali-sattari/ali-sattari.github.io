But despite SRE being around for more than a decade, not all related people are onboard with the practice, some hesitation does come from poor implementation of the observability part[citation needed], giving various stakeholders feeling of loosing insight into their services. Hence to drive adoption, we should do better with visualizing SLIs that are supposed to replace the non-customer-centric metrics2 as center of attention.</description></item></channel></rss>
